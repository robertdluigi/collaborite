## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use Collaborite:

## Server Setup
Create a server to handle WebSocket connections:
```javascript
// src/server.js
const Collaborite = require('collaborite');
const server = new Collaborite(8080);

server.on('connection', (client) => {
    console.log('A user connected');

    client.on('message', (message) => {
        console.log('Received:', message);

        // Broadcast the message to all clients
        server.broadcast(message);
    });

    client.on('close', () => {
        console.log('A user disconnected');
    });
});

console.log('Collaboration Server started on ws://localhost:8080');
```

## Client Setup
Connect to the Collaborite server and send/receive messages:
```javascript
// src/client.js
// src/client.js
const CollaborationClient = require('collaborite'); // Adjust path if necessary

const client = new CollaborationClient('ws://localhost:8080');

// Example usage: send an edit after a delay
setTimeout(() => {
    client.sendEdit('Hello, world!');
}, 3000);
```
